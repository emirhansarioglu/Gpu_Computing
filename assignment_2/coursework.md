# Coursework 3

## Goal

Your task for this week is to implement a parallel **inclusive scan** (prefix sum) for an array of complex numbers based the [Kogge-Stone algorithm](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA074455.pdf) for fast adder circuits:

Complex numbers are represented as adjacent pairs of floats representing the real and imaginary part (see `slow_scan.cu`).
N complex numbers are therefore represented as an arry of N*2 floats.

The operation for the scan is **complex multiplication**.

## Points

The parallel scan has to be computed on the GPU.
Half of the points are awarded for correctness. (see `fast_scan.cu` for implementation without optimiziation)

The other half are awarded for implementing optimizations as discussed in the lecture.

We recommend implementing the optimizations in the following order: (see `optimized_scan.cu`)
1) Reducing Divergence
2) Shared Memory Utilization
3) Thread Coarsening
4) Memory Coalescing (optional)
